                    Sardinia is the key to understanding what lead to the Mega Fauna's
                    (MF) demise. Sardinia's landscape has been deeply scarred by plasma-earth connections from what
                    Dr. Anthony L. Peratt termed the 'Z-Pinch Aurora' (ZPA). From their
                    graphic representations in the Domus di Janas' (DdJs) and on menhirs,
                    neolithic farmers documented two threats from ZPAs. This article will detail 
                    evidence about how the MF came to their demise.

                    Nothing in the annals of geology can explain this landscape
                    in the districts of Marmilla and Trexenta near Gesico, Sardinia. However, neolithic
                    farmers living on the island over four thousand years ago documented what happened. It was not pleasant. They built the massive nuraghi in response. Nuraghe
                    Santu Antine has walls 5 meters thick. Poor farmers would not have built these
                    massive monuments unless confronting extremely powerful forces.
                    A major precept of geology asserts the landscape is shaped over time by erosion.
                    However, Sardinian farmers would say that terrain alteration can occur in a flash of
                    light. This narrative will advance evidence explaining the patterns on Trexenta and
                    Marmilla and the building of the nuraghi.

                    Caves, one of the most protected environments, are full of sediment. The sources of this deposition
                    are largely unsubstantiated. How this material entered caves is critical to understanding why humans 
                    occupied them. Caves were never used as abodes but as shelters from repeated occurrences of Peratt environments.
                    This article provides evidence to support this assertion.
